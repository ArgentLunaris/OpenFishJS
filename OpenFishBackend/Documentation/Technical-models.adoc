= Technical Models

This chapter provides a detailed technical insight into the backend system of the OpenFishJS project.
The backend is developed in Java using the Spring Boot framework and follows a modular, layered architecture.

== 1. System Architecture Overview

The backend application follows a layered architecture:

- **Controller layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **Service layer**: Contains business logic.
- **Repository layer**: Interfaces with the database using Spring Data JPA.
- **Domain/Model layer**: Defines data structures and relationships.

== 2. Package Structure

The project is organized under the base package: `hu.OpenFishBackend`. Each feature is implemented in its own subpackage:

- `controller`: Which contains the endpoints for communication
- `service`: Which contains logic that the application uses in different places
- `repository`: Which contains logic that is responsible for the communication between the backend and the database
- `converter`: Which contains translates the data recieved into information the backend can then use or translates data that the backend sends into data that the frontend can work with
- `dto`: Which contains the models of the data that is being sent or recieved
- `model`: Which contains the models, which the backend works with
- `config`: Which contains the logic responsible for creating and ensuring that the authentication works as intended
- `exceptions`: Which contains the exceptions that the backend can run into


== 3. Entity Models

Each entity is a Java class annotated with `@Entity` and is stored in the model package.

Such as: `Fish` entity in `model/Fish.java`:
[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Data
@Getter
@Setter
@NoArgsConstructor
@JsonIgnoreProperties({"hibernateLazyInitializer", "handler"})
public class Fish {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private int id;
    private String species;
    private String description;
    private String rarity;
    private String wiki;
    private int distance;
    @Column(name="min_weight")
    private float minWeight;
    @Column(name="max_weight")
    private float maxWeight;
    // ... getters, setters
}
----

All entities use JPA annotations, and most are linked via `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne` or `@OneToOne` relations.

== 4. Database

- Uses **MySql** as the database engine.
- ORM provided via Spring Data JPA.
- Each repository interface extends `JpaRepository`.

== 5. Services

Each entity has a `Service` class , such as `FishService` containing business logic.

[source,java]
----
@Service
public class FishService {
    public List<Fish> listAll() {return fishRepository.getAllFish();}

}
----

== 6. REST API Endpoints

Controllers handle HTTP endpoints. Example from `FishController`:

- `GET /fish/getAll`

All endpoints return JSON and use `@RestController` annotation.

== 7. Cors

In this project we do not use the regular policies of cors, rather we use the built-in functions provided by Vite to establish communication between the front and backend of the application.


== 8. Exception Handling

Custom exceptions are defined, as follows: `EmailAlreadyExists`, `FishNotFoundException`.

They are handled in the `@ControllerAdvice` class which is `GlobalExceptionHandler`.

== 9. Security

- Authentication logic consists of a simple encryption method involving Jwt.

== 10. Configuration

- `application.properties` defines DB config.
- Spring Boot auto-configures most components.

== 11. Dependencies

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, WebSocket
- MySql Connector
- Lombok

== 12. Build Tool

- Uses Maven (`pom.xml`)
- Includes plugin configurations for build and dependency management

== Summary

The backend is cleanly modularized and extensible. Real-time support,
REST APIs, and database integration make it a robust architecture for a
singleplayer fishing game.
