6;Airbreathing catfish;Airbreathing catfish belong to the Clariid family, Clariid catfish are characterized by an elongated body, the presence of four barbels, long dorsal and anal fins, and especially by the autapomorphic presence of a suprabranchial organ, formed by tree-like structures from the second and fourth gill arches. This suprabranchial organ, or labyrinth organ, allows some species the capability of traveling short distances on land.;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbreathing_catfish;1;5;1;1;1,5
7;Alligator gar;"The body of an alligator gar is torpedo-shaped, usually brown or olive colored. Their scales are not like the scales of other fishes; rather, they are ganoid scales, which are bone-like, rhomboidal-shaped scales, often with serrated edges, and covered by an enamel-like substance.";https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator_gar;1;5;1;43;47
8;Anglerfish;"It has a very large head which is broad, flat, and depressed; the rest of the body appears to be a mere appendage. The pectoral and pelvic fins are articulated as to perform the functions of feet, so the fish is able to walk along the bottom of the sea, where it generally hides in the sand or amongst seaweed. Around its head and also along the body, the skin bears fringed appendages resembling short fronds of seaweed, a structure which, combined with the ability to match the colour of the body to its surroundings, assists this fish in camouflaging itself";https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lophius_piscatorius;1;100;3;29;35
